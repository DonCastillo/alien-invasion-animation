# The Unexpected Visitor Animation

This project is an animation that requires no input from the user except that, once the ending sequence and
credentials are displayed on the window, pressing the SPACEBAR would restart the animation.

The program works well in a regular computer. In case of Out of Memory Error due to loads of images and sounds in the animation,
you can increase the maximum available memory by going to FILE > PREFERENCES > INCREASE MAXIMUM AVAILABLE MEMORY and set the memory higher
than the default 256 MB.
